# Whoop Detector
Web-camera based timing system for indoor micro quads

### How it works:
* Point your web camera on the wall or on the floor.
* Launch script `detector.py`
* Once whoop appears in front of the camera, the script detects a new lap, beeps and displays lap time.

### Controls:
Space - start/stop detection <br>
Plus/Minus - adjust sensitivity <br>
Enter - clear results <br>
Esc - exit

### How to install:
1) Get the latest version of Python: https://www.python.org/downloads/
2) Install additional modules. Type in command line: <br>
`pip3 install opencv-python` <br>
`pip3 install playsound`
